### This is a very VERY early download for it with no UI currently
#### Game runs best on CONTROLLER. I suggest using it cuz PC KB+M isn't all that great for this

## Running on linux (No executable)
1. Make sure love is installed (`sudo pacman -S love` on arch based distros or `sudo apt install love` on debian)
2. Go to `./src/love` and run the command "`love .`"

## Running on windows (No executable)
1. Make sure love is installed from [the LÖVE2D website](https://love2d.org/)
2. Run the batch files included
> Note: You need to install x64 LÖVE2D for the batch files to work

> Also Note: game.bat is for no console, gamec.bat is for console

## Compiling
